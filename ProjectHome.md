This Maven plugin allows you to configure, from your POM, the lifecycle of an OpenID discovery server and the discovery information it serves out.

For more information on OpenID and discovery, refer to the [OpenID 2.0 specification](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#discovery).
